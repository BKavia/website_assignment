# website_assignment 


The topic for the website is selling Jewellery.
I am required to create the website that I have designed as part of the CTEC3905 Front End Web Development. The website contains four pages: Index page, Collection page, About Us page and Contact page. In the website, JavaScript was used to check the user input. If the user did not write anything in the text boxes, a message is displayed to the user to fill the text field. This was repeated for all the fields in the form. Some javascript was also used for googlemap. CSS styles were added to the website for mobile and desktop. 
W3 School website was used to get some idea for html, css, javaScript, hamburger, transition, animation etc.
