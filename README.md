The topic for the website is selling Jewellery.

I am required to create the website that I have designed as part of the CTEC3905 Front End Web Development. The website contains four pages: Index page, Collection page, About Us page and Contact page. In the website, JavaScript was used to check the user input. If the user did not write anything in the text boxes, a message is displayed to the user to fill the text field. This was repeated for all the fields in the form. Some javascript was also used for googlemap. CSS styles were added to the website for mobile and desktop. Animation and transition were also used on the website.


4 Basic design principles
Proximity:
Alignment:
Repetition:
Contrast: The layout of the website is used simple so that the information is presented in clear way. The colour of the website is visually pleasing to see and make the website attractive. The simple font and font sizes are used for the customers to read content of the pages.

Information Architecture
Users: The user is people who want to buy jewellery. They can be nationally or internationally. 

Content: Simple navigation is used to navigate between pages for the audience. For mobile first, hamburger drop-down list menu used to navigate pages.

Context: The purpose of the jewellery website is to sell products online and traget a many customer. The website is meant to be used by people irrespective of their gender, ethnicity or computer experience. The Jewelry Empire's aim is to get as many customers as possible and make maximum profits from sales.
